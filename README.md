# Powercord 2
Powercord 2 is a lightweight client mod focused on simplicity and performance. It is so lightweight it doesn't even use code.
As of right now, Powercord 2 is in *very* early stages of development, so feel free to join [this server](https://cutt.ly/kyFfEKi) for any questions.

# Installation
See the [installation page of the Powercord Wiki](https://cutt.ly/kyFfEKi).

# How can I install Powercord 2 on Stable or PTB?
You don't. It's already installed. How? Maybe we'll tell you one day :eyes:

# Is this against the ToS?
Long story short... __yes__. Powercord 2 is against the Discord Terms of Service â€” but, you should keep reading:  

It's so lightweight you can't even see it. 

Not even Discord.

Not even Github.

Nobody.

In case you haven't noticed: This is a joke and dumb idea that came up on the Powercord Discord because yes.
Go visit [us](https://discord.gg/5eSH46g), there are some big cutes on there.
Also check out the actual [Powercord](https://github.com/powercord-org/powercord), which is a very good client mod, that works. uwu
